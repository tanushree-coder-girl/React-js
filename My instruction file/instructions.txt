------------- React Js From Beginer To Advanced ----------

1. Introduction 
    React js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    React is used to build single page applications. 
    React Allows us to create reusable bit of code/components. 
    React Was build By facebook. 
    The main focus is to building UI as fast as possible. 
    React Uses Virtual DOM. 
    React Runs on Default port localhost:3000 
    First Released on 29th may 2013. 

2. prerequisite before learn react js
    Before you can code using React, you must have basic knowledge of :
    1) HTML 
    2) CSS 
    3) JavaScript 
    4) ES6 
    5) NPM or YARN 

    Note => Node Js And Npm Must Be installed in your pc to getting started with react. 
    Also git bash should be installed.

3. CMD basics commands or NPM basics commands 
    let's discuss some important cmd or npm commands 
    1) CMD commands 
        1. PWD
            full pathname of working directory 
        2. LS 
            list of directory 
        3. MKDIR 
            create directory 
        4. CD 
            change directory 
        5. CD..
            one level up directory 
        6. clear 
            clean the terminal 
        7. Arrow key up / down 
            previous commands 
        
    2) NPM commands 
        1. NPM init 
            create package.json file 
        2. Npm install <package-name> --save 
            Install package locally 
        3. npm install <package-name> -g 
            install package globaally (sudo)
        4. npm install <package-name> --save-dev 
            use only in development mode 
    
4. React js without installation using cdn links  
    Add Links in Head Tags 
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6.15.0/babel.min.js"></script>

    Now in Script you can write React like this-
    
    <script type="text/babel">
        function App (){
            return ( <h2> Hello world </h2>);
        }
        ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
    </script>

    Note => This way is not for project development this is only for learning purpose 
    for use of project we will use create-react-app installation process. 
    CDN Links is not Recommended this is only for testing purpose. 

5. React Js installation (create-react-app) 
    For install globally create react app command 
    npm install -g create-react-app 

    for checking version installed in your pc use 
    create-react-app --version 

    create a react app directly 
    create a folder inside your folder run create app command for create an react app like: 

    npx create-react-app ecommerce-app 
    cd ecommerce-app 
    yarn start 

    it will create a reaact app names as ecommerce-app 
    by yarn start 
    it will start serve on localhost:3000 

6. File Structure 
    1) Node Modules 
        node Modules contain all the required packages. 
    2) Public Folder 
        public folder contain a root html file. (index.html) and favicons etc. 
        starting Public file =>         public/index.html
    3) src Folder 
        src folder is our main folder where we will start our works 
        All Logic Files Comes Inside This Folder . 
        We will write our code in src folder. 
        starting logic file is =>       src/index.js
    4) .gitignore
        this file is used to ignore file when push code on github 
    5) package.json 
        it contains all required dependency and versions. 
    6) README.md 
        it is just a text file used for github code push.
    7) yarn.lock  
       it contains all required dependency and versions in packages information in detail.
    
7. Clean Boiler plate and understanding main logic file which is src/index.js
    delete all files in public folder except index.html 
    now in index.html files remove all unnecessary comments and unneceesary links tag. 
    inside index.html file there is a div with id root 
     
        <div id="root">
        
        </div>

    now delete all files in src folder 

    now we need a main logic file inside our src folder which is index.js 
    so create index.js inside src folder. 
    this is our main logic file . 

    src/index.js

            //1. import area 
            //Formula :
            //import something from 'something';
            import React from 'react';
            import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

            //2. components area 
            function App(){
                return <h1> Hello world</h1>
            }

            //3. object.method 
            ReactDOM.render( <App />, document.getElementById('root'));

            note: this document.getElementById('root') root comes from public/index.html file.
